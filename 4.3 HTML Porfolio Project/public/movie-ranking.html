<h2>My Top 3 Horror Movie Recommendations</h2>

<hr />

<h3>The Wailing</h3>
<p>
    If someone asks me to recommend a horror movie to watch, this movie is always at the tip of my tongue. Movie plot is
    wild. The struggle to uncover the mystery of who is spreading "the plague" in Korea takes the viewer on a terrifying
    journy of ups and downs.

<h3>The Medium</h3>
<p>
    This movie is the definition of bone chilling horror. The actreass has done a tremendous job of acting being
    possessed. The other part of the scare comes from the religious connotations made in the movie. It's definitely
    worth watching.

<h3>Bramayugam</h3>
<p>
    Bramayugam is a malayalam horror film which grips the viewers attention from the beginning. Although the film is
    shot in the year 2024, the movie has no colors, it is black and white movie and this adds to the unhinged creepiness
    of the movie as our eyes are habitual to see colors. Worth watching!
