  I am also very passionate about electronics and so I have completed courses on Arduino and it's working. I have made projects like remote control car, gesture control car, a 2.5 foot tall robot with servo motors for moving itself, it's hands, neck and also embedded in it ISD module to record and playback a sound. I created my own wifi jammer with help of a code from a github repository. I also created my own spy camera using esp 32 cam module.

  I love watching horror movies. I have watched over 40 of them and I still have lots of them yet to watch. I love watching them because they have a sense of mystery, out of this world concepts and sometimes insane plot twists which entertains me a lot. I love trying new stuff and so I keep experimenting and keep learning, everyday.
